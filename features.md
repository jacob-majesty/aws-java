I - **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a core service provided by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** that allows you to launch and manage **virtual servers** (called instances) in the cloud. It provides resizable compute capacity, meaning you can easily scale up or down based on your application's needs.

### Key Features of EC2:
1. **Virtual Servers**: Run Linux, Windows, or other operating systems on virtual machines.
2. **Scalability**: Easily add or remove instances to handle changes in workload.
3. **Flexibility**: Choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU workloads.
4. **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for the compute time you use.
5. **Security**: Control access using security groups and key pairs.

### Practical Use Cases:
- Hosting web applications or backend services.
- Running batch processing or data analysis jobs.
- Deploying development or testing environments.

### Example for Java Developers:
You can deploy a **Java Spring Boot application** on an EC2 instance by:
1. Launching an EC2 instance.
2. Installing Java and Maven.
3. Cloning your Spring Boot project.
4. Building and running the app with `mvn spring-boot:run`.

EC2 is a foundational AWS service that provides the compute power needed to run your Java applications in the cloud. üåêüíª
